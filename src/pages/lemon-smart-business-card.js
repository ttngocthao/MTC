One key request during our briefing process was that we stayed away from greens, browns and more natural colours. It was important that the client had a brand that punched out from itâ€™s competitors.',
                    'For us that was pretty exciting, we jumped into looking at various colour palettes that gave a high end feel whilst still suiting the industry that they are situated in. In the end, purples, pinks and charcoal was chosen. These vibrant core colours of the purples reflected the wonder of an English summer, showcasing bursts of different flowers that give impact to an outdoor space, against more contemporary slate tones that help marry the core brand visuals.'
